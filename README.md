# DNSDumpster for Firefox

DNSDumpster is a great tool for investigating websites and looking for common DNS entries. I've been using it so much that going to the site, entering the domain (without the protocol or any trailing endpoints), and pressing enter has become a chore.

I wrote a simple firefox addon to open up the site and search the current tab's domain for you.

It also includes an automatic search feature, where going to https://dnsdumpster.com?site=example.com will automatically search example.com for you.

### Installation

The addon is available from the [Firefox Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dnsdumpster/), or from [releases](https://github.com/natesales/dnsdumpster-firefox/releases).
